# GAN_replicates

This project is to replicate original [GAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908.pdf).
The build is finished. 
There are several important things to note in this version:
1. Model is written in Tensorflow, heavily reference from different source on the internet
2. Params are highly referenced and considered by various source on the internet
3. Architecture, training and testing pipeline could be significant for future versions


## Rep contains Two parts:

* Model: CNN models written in Tensorflow

* Train

## ToDo for future versions
1. Different loss function
2. results generating function
3. Mode collapse control
4. Latent space style generating
